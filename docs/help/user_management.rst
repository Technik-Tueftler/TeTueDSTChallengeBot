Authorizations
-----------------
Here is a guide to setting the authorizations for users, channels and commands.

Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently there is no configuration in bot to restrict the commands to a user group or a channel.
The reason is that there is no general functionality for this, as each server has different roles 
and channels and these are always tailored to the server and the community. It would be too 
complicated and unmanageable to add this as a configuration via the bot. That's why I decided to 
transfer this to the server owner and set it manually via the server settings.
